Hello World C-project
=====================

This is just a "helloworld" example project.

The only purpose of this project is to use as a scaffolding
C language project.

The project uses *CMakes* to build the executable, and *CHEAT* for
unit testing.


Build and execute
-----------------

1. From the source directory, generate the "Makefile":

    $ cmake .

2. *Make* the project and generate the executable "helloworld".

    $ make

3. Then execute with:

    $ bin/helloworld

To clean the compiled binaries and compiled modules:

    $ make clean

To clean all compiled files and generated "Makefiles":

    $ make clean-all


Tests
-----

Tests are built with CHEAT <http://users.jyu.fi/~sapekiis/cheat/index.html>,
an unit testing framework for C/C++ programming language.

To run the tests, first build the project and then execute:

    $ bin/test_say_hello
